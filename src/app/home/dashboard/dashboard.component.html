  Dashboard content here.
  <p>
    A dashboard usually contains items of some importance, that need to be addressed
    right away: notices to be sent, reports that need to be completed, newly submitted
    loan applications, etc.
  </p>
  <p>
    To the left, a nav bar shows other topics that may be of interest to the user. Where
    I'm using placeholders, selections may include such things as Clients, Projects, and
    Users for a business app, Men, Women, and Kids for a shopping app, or Campaigns,
    Characters, and Games for a table-top roleplaying app.
  </p>
  <p>
    Stuff will switch to a sub-menu of topics related to, but not belonging amongst, the
    items at the top level. If named Children, for example, selecting it could open a new nav
    bar showing such things as Books, Shoes, and Toys.
