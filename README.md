# Angular Standalone

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 17.3.8.

`Angular Standalone` is a sample Angular application, using the standalone components introduced in Angular 15, and using Angular Material for visual design. I've used this design for multiple projects, as it's straightforward and easily understood by users. The sample serves as a starting point for future projects.

## Install Dependencies

Run `npm i` in both the `angular-standalone` and `angular-standalone/backend` directories to install project dependencies.

## Development servers

Run `npm start` in both the `angular-standalone` and `angular-standalone/backend` directories to start the front- and back-end servers. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/` to view the `Angular Standalone` application. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
